# The Golden Record
The Golden Record was assembled by a team at NASA headed by Carl Sagan in 1977. It is comprised of images and audio which explain to extraterrestrial civilizations what life on Earth consists of. 

The two records today travel abroad the two Voyager spacecraft in hopes of one day making contact with a civilization with the technology to play them. 

This repo consists of the audio files that comprise The Golden Record. They range from greetings from world leaders, sounds of volcanoes erupting, and the works of Johann Sebastian Bach. Please enjoy them as much as I have enjoyed listening to them.
